#memory game

Goals:
Memory game – the idea of the game is to try to match a fitness item with a matching fitness picture (for example, a fitness watch as a fitness item and a picture of a fitness watch is a pair). There will be six pairs for a total of 12 cards. Clicking on cards will have a 3D animation to it while revealing the value. When two are chosen, if it’s a match, both cards will disappear. If it’s not, the cards will flip back over to face-down. The game should be different every time the game is refreshed.

There will be levels to the game from level 1 to level 3:
Level 1: Easy
9 BOXES
3 rows  of 3 boxes

Level 2: Medium
12 BOXES
3 rows of 4 boxes
 
Level 3 * Hardest Level add twist* 
15 BOXES
3 rows of 5 boxes

The game will also display the current number of moves a user has made.
